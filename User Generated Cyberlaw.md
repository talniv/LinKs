## Taking Users' Legal Agency to the Next Level
## Or how to incorporate Users preferences in stringent IP doctrine

## Presumptions
* It's not sufficiently interesting to say that the guidelines and terms and policies of OSPs should be written in Copyright law or change policy, because many have said this before
* I wouldn't want to give such power to Google and Facebook. YUCK. Make them change policy for real. 
* Still, this is not Niva's and Orit's point. Instead, their point is that okay FAIR USE codes should be part of FAIR USE ANALYSIS and they hinge that on the fact that the law needs to maintain its flexibility. 
* I could say that inflexible and tight knit IP policies need to internalize tm policies and copyright policies, and also federal requests, but this is not what i want.
* I want to see how users of the websites can impact the law.  
* Okay: Let's say as follows - users should be allowed to make law as follows: Private OSP policy in Privacy/TM/Copyright/Ownership conflicts/Deceased/Transfers of IPs 
* This is a space that **requires predictability and certainty**, and cannot be tweaked.

## Comments to Niva and Orit
* The problem with Cyberlaw Fair Use Codes is the locality of Fair Use doctrine.
* The other problem is that it requires central coordination. And i don't want that in the traditional way for Cyberspace because it gives all the power to the OSP, or to Facebook and its likes.

## The Normative Case for User Generated Cyberlaw

## Who are the users?
Online service providers, but when they are creating policies, they need to take into consideration their users. In other words, this would be inclusive.

Multi-jurisdictions (the magnusson copyright stealth) interests are brought into consideration. 

It's true that some users are more important than others, but not in all profit models.
