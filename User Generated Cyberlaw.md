# User Generated Copyright
# User Generated Cyberlaw
# Commons Regulation

I'm talking about the 
As you say, Fair Use Best Practices reflect a normative stance; a shared understanding regarding the appropriate scope of fair use within a particular community regarding a particular area of practice. 

## Taking Users' Legal Agency to the Next Level
## Or how to incorporate Users preferences in stringent IP doctrine

## Presumptions
* The problematic situation is not that where there is a group, librarians, script writers, etc. it's the case where there is no group initially. In other words, these are situation where there is no real "best practice" that exists ex ante. In other words, the best practice needs to be created. This is User Generated Regulation. 
* The point about the commons: it is like a knowledge commons, but an organizational commons. 
* the issue is that there is no industry standard, but this also means that there is less the challenge of the lack of objectivity, like the Robinson issue that you are discussing in your paper. Decentralized decision making. Merit based decision making. code custodians. 
* the duty of the OSP would be to frame an organizational infrastructure for decision that doesn't "perpetuate relations and block legal mobility". This is the part that should become standard. 
* Obviousy, when all users follow the same practice, because it is part of their professional life, etc. then it's no trouble at all. here there needs to be a creation of a decisional aparatus that will be interepreted as a civic duty. We can't have a situation where a court will be able to say that only large stakeholders decided.
* In some cases, we don't have a policy 
* it is a situation that needs to bear the fruit of commons regulation, and there is no basis for group agency. 
* Online Social Activism is not just Online Social Activism, it is political activism. They are not just private regulation or private policy making, or community activism or self regulation. They are a form 
* It's not sufficiently interesting to say that the guidelines and terms and policies of OSPs should be written in Copyright law or change policy, because many have said this before
* I wouldn't want to give such power to Google and Facebook. YUCK. Make them change policy for real. 
* Still, this is not Niva's and Orit's point. Instead, their point is that okay FAIR USE codes should be part of FAIR USE ANALYSIS and they hinge that on the fact that the law needs to maintain its flexibility. 
* I could say that inflexible and tight knit IP policies need to internalize tm policies and copyright policies, and also federal requests, but this is not what i want.
* I want to see how users of the websites can impact the law.  
* Okay: Let's say as follows - users should be allowed to make law as follows: Private OSP policy in Privacy/TM/Copyright/Ownership conflicts/Deceased/Transfers of IPs 
* This is a space that **requires predictability and certainty**, and cannot be tweaked.
* Policies are Contracts and terms and guidelines are the new Copyright/TM/Privacy Law/Data Law in cyber space. 

## Comments to Niva and Orit
* The problem with Cyberlaw Fair Use Codes is the locality of Fair Use doctrine.
* The other problem is that it requires central coordination. And i don't want that in the traditional way for Cyberspace because it gives all the power to the OSP, or to Facebook and its likes.  
* I don't think "bottom up" is the best way to refer to it anymore. This is a world of contracts and licenses and standards and terms. If there is any "up", it's the OSP, and the bottom are the users, but I think these terms are too politically charged.

## The Normative Case for User Generated Cyberlaw

## Who are the users?
Online service providers, but when they are creating policies, they need to take into consideration their users. In other words, this would be inclusive.

Multi-jurisdictions (the magnusson copyright stealth) interests are brought into consideration. 
it is the only thing to do to allow that. 

It's true that some users are more important than others, but not in all profit models. 

## What is the Law-making process?
Use the power of the OSP to grant an organizational infrastructure to user decision.
1. The LEGAL obligation of the OSP is:
    1. to create a decision-making super-structure
    2. To have a clear policy about how to accept user and implement user change
    3. Broadcast power of changes + Continuous access to current policy and ongoing discussion.
    4. Take into consideration all stake holders. If there is a clear reason to prefer one stakeholder, the policy needs to include a part that explains why and the OSP should be clear about it. 
    5. Take into consideration all jurisdictions
    6. The default: General public. Commons production. Access. The argument is that non-users can only be represented by the OSP and he needs to. 
2. The decision power of users?
    1. Ongoing. Like every content, policy content. 
    2. Meritocratic, or based on activity level or any other built in hierarchy.  
    3. Not open and shut for participation but always open. 
        1. not like mozilla or wikipedia
3. How will formal law and courts help: Standardize good policies to make the be used across the board. 
4. 
Advantages: Disruptive websites in policies that users prefer.


## Use Cases
### Fair Use in Copyright
### "Fair Use" in TM
 So what about copyright infringement? In the related Hacker News thread, a number of the projects' authors weigh in on the censorship, making persuasive cases that they software did not infringe on any of Whatsapp's copyrights -- rather, these were tools that made use of the Whatsapp API, were proof-of-concept security tools for Whatsapp, or, in one case, merely contained the string "whatsapp" in its sourcecode. 

### Take Down Policy

### TM Take down policy
### Account ownership policy and disputes
### User IP Policy
### 
### Cyber Security and Information Requests from Government
#### Public Repo for participation. Decisions of merge. The Wikipedia decision process. EPA and what's considered a legitimate notice period for a regulatory agency's regulatory decisions

### What can the OSP do? Suggest a range of policies. Explain the stakes for each. 
#### Government agency requests for user information
this will buttress the rights of OSPs in front of government.
