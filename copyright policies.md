1. presenting US copyright like it is "the copyright"

However, copyright does not protect all expressions. As explained by the U.S. Copyright Office, "copyright does not protect names, titles, slogans, or short phrases. In some cases, these things may be protected as trademarks." 

2. taking out of copyright things that are not interepreted as copyright

    Impostor accounts
    Hacked accounts
    Abuse and harassment
    Pages and groups admin issues
    Privacy rights
    Functionality issues
    Usernames and web addresses
    
These might obviously be considered by users as part of copyright
