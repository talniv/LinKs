1. presenting US copyright like it is "the copyright"

However, copyright does not protect all expressions. As explained by the U.S. Copyright Office, "copyright does not protect names, titles, slogans, or short phrases. In some cases, these things may be protected as trademarks." 

2. taking out of copyright things that are not interepreted as copyright

    Impostor accounts
    Hacked accounts
    Abuse and harassment
    Pages and groups admin issues
    Privacy rights
    Functionality issues
    Usernames and web addresses
    
These might obviously be considered by users as part of copyright

3. most commons questions. non of them is the status of copyright and the license you give facebook when you put on content. what is the status of content

Common Questions
1. What if I want to upload content to Facebook but I'm not sure whether that would infringe someone's copyright?
Do I own the copyright to content that I filmed on my own camcorder or phone from the television, live concert, or sporting event?
2. Someone is posting unauthorized images of my child who is a minor.

those can't be the top most questions that are relevant to copyright

4. facebook Copyright assets presented as "brands" (policy specified in a brand resources page)
5. https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms - the treatment of the users' copyright:

**Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
* what about content that isn't covered by ip rights? 
* royalty free

    When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
* it is deleted in a maner "similar to emptying the recicle bin on the computer"
* "reasonable period of time" - what does that mean?
    When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.  (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data Use Policy and Platform Page.)
    When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
    We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
    
    6. application settings page doesn't, in fact, treat copyrightable information but "App Settings
On Facebook, your name, profile picture, cover photo, gender, networks, username, and user id are always publicly available, including to apps (Learn Why). Apps also have access to your friends list and any information you choose to make public." https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications

7. FB platform Policy
https://developers.facebook.com/policy/

facebook says nothing about the content of the platform developer. It only talks about its content and 3rd party content. What I believe that entails is that it means that FB intends that the content policy in the standard TOS is what applies. It has nothing to add.
