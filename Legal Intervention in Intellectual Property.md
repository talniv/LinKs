### Topic: The Case for a Legal Intervention Institution in IP

**The mainstay is the fact of intervention, not the type of intervention**

#### when is legal intervention advantageous?
* Creative environments are, by nature, in flux
    * the law will never be able to catch up with develoopments in creative environments
    * lag is inherent in law, because of the legal processs, and because of the way that the law evolves and changes
    * legacy IP laws rhetoric that doesn't fit the new tech world is fruitless because every legal change becomes legacy because technology is perpetum mobile.
    * ex post correction in creative environments whose nature is progress in content and structure
    * an added benefit: "in vivo" experimentation of the legal *prescription*
* it is much more genuine to admit that there is intervention rather than stretch the truth in cases like eBay v. Merck
* Law is often inflexible, tight neat around IP convention
* A de fact consideration: The rhetoric of the rights of the author is so strong and it is very hard to find exceptions to it. An intervention to correct gross injustice after, obviously, an adequate institutional process is much easier. 
    
* we have an intitutive understanding of when the law is ill-fit in IP so it is much easier to define reasons and process for intervention. 

* examples of inadequacy that would better be solved by intervention than by efforts of change (by legislation or judicial intervention)
    * when IP law produces gross harms or costs, or is clearly unjust
    * when IP law prevents great benefits
        * successful software projects

## when it's superior to fair use or fair dealing
* not necessarily small scale reductions in the power of the "rights holder". 
can be large ones
* different normative weight for intervention; it is clear declaration that it is right to lessen the power of the rights holder


## when it's superior to obligatory license
license is a wrong term to use when the terms are not defined by the rights holder.

## all IP
a change in the law is not desirable, but it is must to reach "the right" outcome 

## the law becomes relevant in circumstnaces that are usually not occupied by legal agents
for instance!!! it is beautiul that online creative environments tick without the actors being made into legal agents. Think Flickr, YouTube. Why should we encourage IP licensing in those situations?

## the remedy can be far more extensive when you don't need to treat it as a precedence! 

### why does it need to be an institution?
obviousness of legitimacy
possibility of legislating when the "experiment" turned out to be superior to the legal status quo
a process
professionals aking decisions.
