The Case for a Legal Intervention Institution in IP

**The mainstay is the fact of intervention, not the type of intervention**

* when is legal intervention advantageous
    * the law will never be able to catch up with develoopments in creative environments
    * lag is inherent in law, because of the legal processs, and because of the way that the law evolves and changes
    * the rhetoric about legacy IP laws that do not accommodate a changing world is fruitless because it always hits a road block in "the next moment" that it is always inadequate to accommodate
    * ex post correction in creative environments 
    
* we have an intitutive understanding of when the law is illfit in IP so it is much easier to define reasons and process for intervention. 

* examples of inadequacy that would better be solved by intervention than by efforts of change (by legislation or judicial intervention)
    * when IP law produces gross harms or costs, or is clearly unjust
    * when IP law prevents great benefits
